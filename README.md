# install

To install vundle follow:
https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim

To install Tomorrow-Night theme:
https://github.com/chriskempson/vim-tomorrow-theme
It's a deprecated repository, didn't manage yet to install it through base16 new repo
so I provide the color scheme in this repo, just do:
cp Tomorrow-Night.vim ~/.vim/colors/
